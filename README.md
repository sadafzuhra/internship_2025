#Microinformatics Internship 2025 - Python Series

Hi there!

Thank you for visiting this repository. This is part of a comprehensive learning journey I completed during the Microinformatics Internship 2025 led by Haseeb Raza. The internship focused on applying Python programming to tackle real-world problems in biomedical science using data-driven methods and machine learning.

Inside this repository, you'll find:

Python scripts from hands-on tasks and assignments

Well-commented code for easier understanding and learning

Projects in Multiomics and Computational Drug Discovery

Practical exercises related to antimicrobial resistance and cancer detection

Resources and references used throughout the internship


Whether you're new to bioinformatics or looking to improve your Python skills for biomedical research, this repository is structured to be educational, project-based, and beginner-friendly.

I hope you find it helpful — and if you do, feel free to star the repo and share it with others!
